      "description": "3-D Printing has been dubbed as the technology of the future! Indeed it has many reasons that advocate the stance. It is currently the best rapid manufacturing technology for personalised manufacturing and rapid prototyping and is slowly finding its way into the industry. It has been predicted that it will be the harbinger of the 3rd industrial revolution.\nTo familiarise students with this modernistic and cutting-edge technology and to teach them about the basics of 3-D Printing, is the desideratum of this workshop. The workshop will be attended by students from a large verity of branches including computer, electrical, IT, mechanical, civil and even biotech engineering! This goes to show the vast appeal of this technology. \nThe workshop shall havedistinguished guests coming from international companies. The introductory session, consisting of basics of 3-D Printing and additive manufacturing, processes, materials and printers used in the process, 3-D Printers set up during the workshop will demostrate the technology to the students live. The next session will introduce the participants to basics of CAD software designing and slicing technique. The students will be given several useful softwares and taught to design their own objects. The third session, focusses specifically on Metal RP (Rapid Prototyping). The students shall be shown several high grade metal components made using titanium and aluminium. After the lunch break, the fourth session, consisting of 3-D scanning, will showcase state of the art 3-D scanners. At the end the students will have the hands-on sessions with the scanners and printers. This is the most interesting and exciting part for the participants, because most of them havent seen or used a 3-D Printer before. The participants also get their designed models 3-D printed given to them as mementos!\nThey will surely looking forward to explore more frontiers of this very unique technology!",

This round mainly deals with how creatively can the participants solve a problem which is occurring in/on  their ship. This is not on the software but a normal question answer session.\n5. After each KSP round there is one challenger round.\n6.The participants are judged on various parameters and a leaderboard is made after every round.\n7.

The questions will be based on chemical reactions, periodic table and basic laboratory experiments. Top 20 teams solving the pathway maze of questions in minimum time will be promoted to the second round.\nSecond Round: This is the practical round in which each will have to perform various practical experiments like redox titrations, color change experiments etc. After each experiment they will get a new color or a new value of titration which is their hint to a location for the final complex. Once they find the location and the final complex of the chain reaction, top three teams fetching it in minimum time will be awarded as the winner",

The event consists of 3 modules which if included by the participants in their designs, they will be given extra points. \n\n Think intelligent: Make use of the following objects in this module to the best as possible  CANDLE, SPOON, BOOK, MOBILE, CLOTHESPIN, BRICK   or any items which you think can fit in. It is not mandatory that you include all these objects. For every use of the object mentioned in the first module, 10 points will be given.\nPut your basic engineering skills to test with so many twists and turns.

      "description": "Greatest Heist is an exciting classroom maze event wherein the participants (in teams of 2) make their way through a challenging\nobstacle course   dodging the lasers, crossing the ropes, avoiding different types of sensors : IR sensors, Piezoelectric sensors, PIR sensors and much more. It consists of a single round and both the participants of the team enter the arena together solving through the maze. Both of them complete a segment of the course and reach a point where they separate. At this point the participants have to make a quick decision which one will go through which path. One of the course will consist of lasers and sensors whereas in the other the participant will have to cross through a demanding track made of ropes, tyres and bamboos. The event requires good co-ordination among the team members. The scoring is based on the number of lasers, sensors left undisturbed as well as how well the Rope track has been crossed. The team to finish the course in least time possible as well as complete the tasks efficiently is declared a winner.\n\nSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE\nWhen the participants open the money vault, they surprisingly find no money but rather old clothes which they need to choose one out of them and the cloths would be given to the needy by their name bringing out a social initiative in the event. Though the winners are declared by the least time taken but adding this kind of surprise would be a meaningful initiative taken up in the event.",

The concept  introduced in Jumble Coding is that the algorithm used is not constant; it changed depending on certain fixed events.\nThe participants were judged on the basis of correctness of their code and the time taken to solve the given problem. The event had an amazing response from not only CSE or IT students but also from the students of other branches.",

A demonstration on how fiber optics along with nanoparticles can be exploited for biomolecule detection using immunoassays and nucleid acid assays will be held.",

The total elapsed time to complete each run, from 'Start!' signal to Finish line, will be recorded by stopwatch or equivalent.\n2)Drag round: The drag Competition shall be vehicle vs. vehicle, on two lanes of full width and matching lengths to the Finish Line. Vehicles advance by double-elimination Brackets to determine a Racing Competition Champion, one Finalist (Second Place), and two Semi-Finalists (Third Place tie).\nAlso there will be a design contest in which teams need to present the design of their car.\nPrior to the competition there will be one more qualification round in which participants need to submit their report on the basis of report top 30 teams will be selected for the event.

Reverse Engineering, as many of you might already have heard of involves going back to a concept from the prototype. This technique is often adopted by organizations while developing new products or improving the existing products. It is also used for studying the technology used by competitors and Market leaders of that Industry. In this competition, the participant has to prove his understanding of fundamental concepts as an engineer. It requires them to have a systematic approach to analyzing and reasoning the engineering design of devices and systems.",
